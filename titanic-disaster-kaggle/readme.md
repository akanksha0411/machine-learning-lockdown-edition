- In this repository, I have used the Titanic data set from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic . I have done Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering on the data. In the end I have implemented the decision tree algorithm using sklearn. Also, validated using K-folds validation thereby choosing the most efficient max_depth attribute. It isnt of any use to you because I haven't commented my code.
